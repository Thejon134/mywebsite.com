        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p id="p1">My name is Jonathan Alexis Bruno and I was born and raised in Phoenix, AZ by both of my parents in a hispanic household with my two younger siblings. Growing up was a challenge as English became my second language, I had to learn and adapt with my surroundings, thus allowing me to become self resourceful. Being a music fanatic I then learned how to play multiple instruments like the guitar, piano, drums, bass and also sing. The love for music has helped through the struggles and challenges in life as it allowed me to channel my emotions and fears through a wordless poem only I could create at the time. After graduating from High School I decided to pursue a career in Psychology. Unfortunately it didn't fall through as I learned that psychology can be very difficult to find any job opportunities after graduating. 
                    I then started to work in many companies in different fields like: warehouse, aerospace, and even customer service. During this time I met my beautiful wife while attending a church event after my mom had invited me. I got married and we are both currently in the process of building a foundation for our future family. Currently working at Amazon, I learned about the opportunities Amazon gives for schooling. This got me ecstatic as schooling was not an option at first as it can be expensive, but I wanted to continue to expand my knowledge and took the opportunity that was given. Now I'm In the process of completing one of my life goals which is to pursue a career in the technology field. I know it will take some time to do so but to finish the race you have to first take a step forward. Through this opportunity I'm able to see my future clearly as I am still writing my destiny and starting small like making this webpage about myself in HTML form. 
                    Excited for the future and what it holds, I will continue to grow and make my dreams come true for myself and for the people I love.</p>
